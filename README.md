# Welcome to the Reactive Systems implementation examples in .NET!

This repository provides practical examples of how Reactive Systems can be implemented in a way that is efficient, scalable, and resilient, using the .NET framework. According to the [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/), Reactive Systems are **"Responsive, Resilient, Elastic, and Message-Driven."** This means that they are designed to handle a large number of events and inputs in a timely and responsive manner, while also being able to adapt to changes in the environment and recover from failures.

### Examples Based on the Pillars of Reactive Systems:

The examples provided in this repository are carefully crafted to align with the four main pillars of Reactive Systems: **Responsiveness, Resilience, Elasticity, and Message-Driven** architecture. Each example demonstrates how these pillars can be incorporated into the development of reactive systems using the .NET framework.

***You can explore the examples in the following locations:***

•	[Responsiveness Examples](https://github.com/M-Rashidi/aspnetcore-reactive-application/tree/main/responsive): These examples showcase techniques for building highly responsive systems that can quickly react to incoming events and inputs, ensuring smooth and timely user experiences.

•	[Resilience Examples](https://github.com/M-Rashidi/aspnetcore-reactive-application/tree/main/resilient): In these examples, you'll discover strategies to build resilient systems that can gracefully handle failures and adapt to unexpected scenarios, ensuring the continuity of critical functionalities.

•	[Elasticity Examples](https://github.com/M-Rashidi/aspnetcore-reactive-application/tree/main/elastic): Explore these examples to learn how to design systems that can dynamically scale up or down to handle varying workloads, allowing your applications to efficiently utilize available resources.

•	[Message-Driven Examples](https://github.com/M-Rashidi/aspnetcore-reactive-application/tree/main/message-driven): these examples dive into the benefits of a message-driven architecture, showcasing how systems can effectively process and communicate messages between components, enabling loose coupling and flexibility.

Each example provides practical insights and code snippets to guide you through the implementation process, allowing you to gain a deeper understanding of building reactive systems that excel in responsiveness, resilience, elasticity, and message-driven communication.
Feel free to explore these examples, experiment with the code, and adapt the concepts to suit your specific project needs. We encourage your active participation and contributions to help expand the knowledge base and foster a vibrant community around reactive systems in the .NET ecosystem.
